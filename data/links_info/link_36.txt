On this page [ show ] [ hide ] How common is breast cancer? Lifetime chance of getting breast cancer Trends in breast cancer incidence Trends in breast cancer deaths Differences by race and ethnicity Breast cancer survivors How common is breast cancer? Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States, except for skin cancers. It accounts for about 30% (or 1 in 3) of all new female cancers each year. The American Cancer Society's estimates for breast cancer in the United States for 2025 are: About 316,950 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women. About 59,080 new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will be diagnosed. About 42,170 women will die from breast cancer. Breast cancer mainly occurs in middle-aged and older women. The median age at the time of breast cancer diagnosis is 62. This means half of the women who developed breast cancer are 62 years of age or younger when they are diagnosed.  A very small number of women diagnosed with breast cancer are younger than 45. Lifetime chance of getting breast cancer Overall, the average risk of a woman in the United States developing breast cancer sometime in her life is about 13%. This means there is a 1 in 8 chance she will develop breast cancer. This also means there is a 7 in 8 chance she will never have the disease. Trends in breast cancer incidence In recent years, incidence rates have increased by 1% per year. The rise in incidence rates is a little steeper in women younger than 50 (1.4%). This is thought to be due to risk factors of having excess body weight, not having children, or having a first child after age 30. Trends in breast cancer deaths Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. (Only lung cancer kills more women each year.) The chance that any woman will die from breast cancer is about 1 in 43 (about 2.3%). Breast cancer death rates have been decreasing steadily since 1989, for an overall decline of 44% through 2022.The decrease in death rates is believed to be the result of finding breast cancer earlier through screening and increased awareness, as well as better treatments. Differences by race and ethnicity Some variations in breast cancer can be seen in racial and ethnic groups. For example: Black women have the highest death rate from breast cancer. This is thought to be partially because Black women have a higher risk of triple-negative breast cancer , more than any other racial or ethnic group. At every age, Black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than any other race or ethnic group. White, Asian, and Pacific Islander women are more likely to be diagnosed with localized breast cancer than Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and Alaska Native women. Asian and Pacific Islander women have the lowest death rate from breast cancer. Breast cancer survivors At this time there are more than 4 million breast cancer survivors in the United States. This includes women still being treated and those who have completed treatment. Survival rates are discussed in Survival Rates for Breast Cancer .
