The advantages of speaking another language might depend on how you use it getty For anyone feeling bad because they never got around to learning another language, take some comfort from new research, which shows that—for a second language to be effective for the brain—it actually depends on how you use it. People are often told that speaking more than one language is good for your brain and possibly improves intelligence. Research commonly states that it can improve brain function and delay the onset of dementia, regardless of the age when learning begins. What's more, being bilingual is seen as one better; that switching back and forth between two languages radically improves the brain's functionality because both languages have to stay constantly "active". People that use more than one language often come out well in exercises that show better working memory and better 'attentional control', because, for example, bilinguals are shown to be able to ignore irrelevant information and focus on a target. When someone starts learning a language, the brain is known to increase its frontal cortex to handle the incoming language. However, if someone stays using both languages, then the basal ganglia and cerebellum develop, to literally change the brain over time . MORE FOR YOU It's not uncommon to speak more than one language. The Guardian reported that more than half the world's population speak at least two, with estimates ranging from 60-75%. Some countries have more than one national language (South Africa has 11) and additionally, people are required to speak the "super" languages, such as English, Arabic or Hindi. Bilingualism is complicated—research suggests it's how you use the second language that counts getty But it's complicated. New research shows that it's not as simple as once thought—some exercises conducted between monolinguals and bilinguals show that sometimes there is no discernible difference in cognitive functions . Or sometimes there are differences but they aren't consistent. The Conversation reported that maybe a better way to see bilingualism is as existing on a spectrum and the answer about how smart it makes someone completely depends on how they use the second language. People use languages in different ways and at different times—some use one language at work and another at home; others switch constantly between them. For bilinguals, the cognitive advantages can depend on when you learned a second language, from birth or much later. It can also depend on how often a person uses both languages. All these factors may impact how the brain interprets being bilingual and might adapt accordingly. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER...
