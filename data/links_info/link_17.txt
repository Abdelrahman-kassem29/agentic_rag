Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Eva Amsen writes about the overlap of science and art Follow Author Aug 23, 2020, 05:32pm EDT Aug 23, 2020, 05:32pm EDT Share Save This article is more than 5 years old. A recent research study suggests that learning music doesn't make you smarter. For parents who have been encouraging their children to take music lessons, this could be a disconcerting message, but it may not be as bad as you think. We already knew that music doesn't make you more intelligent, or suddenly good at taking tests in other subjects, and that's really all this study confirms. A new study suggests that music lessons do not increase children's intelligence. But there are still other reasons why music lessons can be valuable for school kids. getty First, it's important to know that this isn't based on new research, but is an analysis of existing studies. The authors of the study, Giovanni Sala (Fujita Health University) and Fernand Gobet (London School of Economics) did a systematic analysis of several studies that all looked at the effect of music on measures of intelligence or academic achievement. They looked at how music lessons affected students' scores on memory tests, for example, or on tests that measured their reasoning skills, literacy skills or ability to solve mathematics problems. The researchers chose a set of strict criteria to select these studies, so that they would be able to compare similar types of experiments between papers. For example, they only compared studies that had randomly assigned students to either receive music lessons or not, and ignored studies on existing music classes (without a non-music control). After a careful analysis of the combined findings of 54 carefully selected studies, Sala and Gobet concluded that on the whole, students who received music education did not automatically score better on tests that measured their intelligence or academic ability. Is this something to worry about? That depends partly on what you believe the purpose of music lessons is. If you believe music is valuable as a creative skill, or an enriching social activity, then this research won't affect you much. It's only a concern if you think music is a way to increase intelligence - but this isn't the first time that the link between music and intelligence has been disproven. For a while, there was an idea floating around the internet and various magazines that suggested that babies could become smarter if they listened to Mozart, or to other classical music. Inspired, some parents bought classical CDs for their babies in the hopes that this would boost their intelligence. But this so-called "Mozart Effect" has been debunked several times. Listening to classical music is not making children any more intelligent. MORE FOR YOU But surely taking music lessons is different from just listening to music? Wouldn't taking lessons make kids smarter? That's exactly the question that many researchers over the years have tried to answer. Some of their studies concluded that it does, and some found that it doesn't. For example, one study showed that music education did not improve reading skills, while another one found a small effect of music on young children's ability to manipulate syllables and words. Sala and Gobet looked at the data behind these studies and 52 others, and after carefully comparing the data from different papers, they concluded that children who were assigned music lessons did not score higher on tests that measure their intelligence or academic ability than kids that didn't learn music. If music doesn't make you smarter, how does that explain other research that show that music lessons help students' school performance? For example, last year a large study from Canada found that high school students did better in math, science and English classes if they also took music lessons. That study was not one of the ones included in this new meta-analysis, because it hadn't randomly assigned students to attend music classes or not. That means that there could have been other factors, besides music, that determined how well the students did in their classes. For example, perhaps the students who already did well in school were more likely to be the ones who were encouraged to take music, while those struggling were advised to focus on other subjects. Or the students who took music lessons were from wealthier families, more likely to invest in music activities beyond the school curriculum. But as I mentioned when I covered this Canadian study last year , the authors took all of that into account and still found that kids who had taken music lessons fared better in other classes. At first glance, that sounds very different from what this new study by Sala and Gobet found. How can it be possible for music lessons to have no effect on intelligence, and still lead to kids doing better in school? It seems like there is something about music lessons that makes students able to perform better in their other classes. That doesn't have to be intelligence, and it's likely not. If intelligence was the main factor behind school performance, every student would always do equally well in their classes. But they don't. Grades go up and down over the years so there must be other factors besides intelligence or the ability to take a test that could affect how well someone does in school. Music lessons could have helped in different ways: They could have led to a change in homework habits, they could have increased confidence, or they could have improved social skills. Sala and Gobet's analysis only looked at measures of intelligence and performance on particular tests, not at any of the other possible factors that would lead a student to do better in class. The authors even mention this in their paper. They say "music may be beneficial for non-cognitive constructs in children, such as prosocial behavior and self-esteem". And finally, they also mention that music education could still be very beneficial to students' performance in non-music subjects if the music is integrated into these classes. For example, if music is used in a math lesson or a science lesson, that could help make the material more memorable. But again, this was not something they looked at in the new paper. So feel free to keep making music, and keep encouraging children to learn music. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER... FORBES’ FEATURED Video © 2025 Forbes Media LLC.
